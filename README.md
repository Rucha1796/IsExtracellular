# IsExtracellular
The IsExtracellular Python script reads a TSV file of peptide data, maps post-translational modifications to their positions in protein sequences, and determines their subcellular location (extracellular or not) using UniProt topology data. It also flags proteins in the Wollscheid surfaceome list and saves annotated results as an Excel file.
